# AMOI: AI-Aided Microorganisms Identification

AMOI is a Python-based tool that uses machine learning techniques to identify microorganisms in environmental samples. The tool is designed to help researchers and scientists efficiently analyze large amounts of data and identify microorganisms in a more automated and accurate way. The project was developed as a part of a graduate project and includes detailed documentation.

## Introduction

AMOI uses techniques such as image processing and deep learning to identify microorganisms in environmental samples. The tool can be trained on various datasets and is capable of detecting and classifying a wide range of microorganisms. The project includes a web-based interface that allows users to easily upload and analyze their data.

## Usage

To use AMOI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Run the web-based interface by launching a local web server that you can access in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

4. Upload your environmental samples to the web interface and follow the prompts to analyze the data.

## Limitations

While AMOI is a powerful tool for identifying microorganisms in environmental samples, it does have some limitations. For example:

- The accuracy of the tool depends on the quality and quantity of the data used to train it.
- The tool may not be able to identify certain rare or unknown microorganisms.

## Conclusion

AMOI is a useful tool for identifying microorganisms in environmental samples using machine learning techniques. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
